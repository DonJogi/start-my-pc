Start My PC
========================

Little app to start your PC with your voice.

As long as it's not possible to implement custom voice actions, a little workaround is needed.

The idea is that there's an invisible App called "My PC" that just sends a magic packet to wake your PC via Wake-on-LAN.
Because Android can start apps with the command "start", it's therefore possible to wake your PC by just saying "Start my pc".

Wear Support
=======================

There's a small companion app that can also send the magic packet.
